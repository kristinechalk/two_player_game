Enhancement to your Game, with Exceptions
Getting Familiar with Exceptions
Prior to starting this exercise, you should read the following introductory writeups:

http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/ruby_exceptions.html
http://www.skorks.com/2009/09/ruby-exceptions-and-exception-handling/
As you read through these, I would suggest that you experiment with the code that they use as examples.

Implement Custom Exceptions
Rather than just having logical tests for whether answers are correct, or players being out of lives, implement custom exceptions for these events.

The following are some custom exceptions that you could do:

incorrect guess (InvalidGuessError)
out of lives (PlayerDeadError)
Tip

You can raise RuntimeError exceptions for this exercise, at first. This is the simplest type of error to raise, because you can just use a string.

Example:

raise "Play out of turn!"
Question: If this raises a RuntimeError exception class, what is the string used for?

Once you have the RuntimeError exception performing correctly, implement a custom exception.
