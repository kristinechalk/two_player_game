## Two Player Math Game

A 2-player guessing game where players take turns to answer simple math problems. The math questions are automatically generated by the game. 

Both players start with 3 lives. They lose a life if they mis-answer a question. If a player gets a question wrong, the game outputs the new scores for both players, so players know where they stand.

The game doesn’t end until one of the players loses all their lives. At this point, the game announce who won and what the other player’s score is.
